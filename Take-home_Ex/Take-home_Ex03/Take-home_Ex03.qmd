The original dataset was downloaded from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/) titled *Resale flat princes based on registration date from Jan-2017 onwards.*

The file downloaded was *resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2017-onwards.csv*

The focus of the study is on **3-ROOM, 4-ROOM and 5-ROOM types** for **2022** period.
