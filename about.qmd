This website consists of a collection of works done for the visual analytics course I took during my MITB journey. You can treat this as a portfolio of my work.

The visualisation work is done with Tableau, R packages and Shiny app.

There are four types of exercise:

1.  **Hands-on Exercise**

    Trying out new visualisation skills and technique

2.  **In-Class Exercise**

    Relevant notes from lecture by Prof. Kam Tin Seong

3.  **Take-home Exercise**

    Application of skills learned in class in real-life problems
