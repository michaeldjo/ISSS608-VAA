    "text": "3. Discussion\nThis section discusses the reasoning behind decisions made in creating the visualization and patterns revealed by the analysis.\n\n3.1 Unequal population distribution by planning area\nBy choosing all the filters (Figure 2), we can roughly group the planning areas (PAs) to three different categories:\n\nNon-residential PAs\nLower populated PAs\nHigher populated PAs\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Displaying all PAs reveals unequal population distribution across planning areas\n\n\nThe first category would fall under non-residential zones, which are mainly used for either commercial (Downtown), industrial (Changi), or natural zone (Central Water Catchment). Note this does not necessarily mean zero population, areas like Downtown have small residential populations, most likely represented by high-end luxury apartments.\nThe second category (i.e., Jurong East, Kallang, Novena) could be explained by mixed-area land-uses or simply due to smaller PA size, while the last category (i.e., Sengkang, Tampines, Yishun) is full-fledged residential area. Figure 3 below shows the three distinct PA categories.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Three distinct PA categories revealed by the dashboard\n\n\nAs such, it makes sense to show the absolute population instead of percentage of PA population in the x-axis to showcase this unequal distribution. On top of that, we will exclude non-residential PAs from the analysis as they hold little significance.\n\n\n3.2 Different shapes of age-sex pyramids across PAs\nFrom Figure 2 above, we can analyze not only the total population, but also the varying shapes of the pyramids across PAs. These pyramids have common features like thinning population at their pinnacles (eldest age-group) and thicker middle age-groups. However, there are notable differences as well.\nReferring to Figure 4 below, Bedok, Jurong West, and Ang Mo Kio pyramids are more rounded-shaped. Their highest age-group proportions lie around 50-70 years, with thinner population in other age-groups, indicating aging population.\nOn the other hand, Chua Chu Kang, Pasir Ris and Tampines still have high 50-70 years age-group population, but there is clear emerging young populations (20-35 years), making the pyramids look more like arrow-shaped. These trends are more prominent on the younger towns. Punggol is an extreme case with highly accentuated 35-45 and 5-10 years age groups.\nSome unique cases like Sembawang and Toa Payoh offer unexpectedly high 30-35 age-group, which almost looks like outliers, making the pyramids look jagged.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Analyzing different shapes of age-sex pyramids\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Gender Ratio on each PA is relatively constant\nChoosing the 9 most populated PAs reveal relatively constant gender ratio on each PA, despite different shapes of the pyramids. This is accentuated in Figure 5 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Nine most populated PA age-sex pyramids\n\n\nTo illustrate this, we can examine Jurong West and Punggol age-sex pyramids closely. Jurong West pyramids look rounded. Meanwhile, Punggol has a completely different arrow-shaped pyramid. Despite these differences, the proportion of male vs female population remains rather constant for different age groups (mirror-image across central axis). This observation is quite consistent across different PAs chosen.\nIt is noted, however, that at the higher age group, there tend to be more females than males. This is shown most clearly in Bedok PA (90 and over) with 1440 females vs 660 males. Combining this information with relatively uniform gender-ratio at the lower age group, this could be explained by higher life expectancy of females."
