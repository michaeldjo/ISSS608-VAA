    "text": "2. Exercises\n\n2.1 Using ggiraph for interactive data visualization\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive. The interactivity is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\n\nIf it is used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.\n\n2.1.1 Using tooltip (tooltip effect)\nThere are two parts of the codes: 1. creating ggplot object, 2. girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\nmy_plot <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  \n  #geom_dotplot_interactive still takes argument of original geom_dotplot but with tooltip enabled in aes()\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n2.1.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nWhat if we want to display Student ID and Class while hovering with tooltip?\n\n#Creating new field called tooltip\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,\n  \"\\n Class\", exam_data$CLASS\n))\n\nmy_plot2 <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  \n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip),         #refer to the tooltip field above\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot2,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n2.1.3 Customising tooltip style\nUsing opts_tooltip to customise tooltip rendering by adding css declaration\n\ntooltip_css <- \"background-color:white; font-style:bold; color:red;\"\n\nmy_plot3 <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  \n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot3,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_tooltip(\n      css = tooltip_css)\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Background color is now white and the font color is red and bold\n\n\n2.1.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nIn this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip. This is created by creating a function\n\ntooltip_fn <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {   \n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy) \n  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy) \n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)                      \n} \n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = RACE)) +\n  \n  stat_summary(\n    aes(y = MATHS, \n        tooltip = after_stat(\n          tooltip_fn(y, ymax))),\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\",\n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,\n    fill = \"lightblue\"\n    ) +\n  \n  stat_summary(\n    aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\",\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = gg_point,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Using data_id (hover effect)\n\nmy_plot <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = CLASS),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over. Note that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n2.1.6 Customising hover effect style\nUsing css declaration to change the highlighting effect\n\nmy_plot2 <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = CLASS),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot2,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: pink;\"),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over. Notice opts_hover refers to the selected data and opts_hover_inv refers to the non-selected data.

Note that click actions must be a string column in the dataset containing valid javascript instructions.\n\n\n2.1.9 Coordinated multiple views with ggiraph\nCoordinated multiple views methods is interactive in which when a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too.\nIn order to build a coordinated multiple views, the following programming strategy will be used:\n\nAppropriate interactive functions of ggiraph will be used to create the multiple views.\npatchwork function of patchwork package will be used inside girafe function to create the interactive coordinated multiple views.\n\n\np1 <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID,\n        data_id = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\np2 <- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  \n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID,\n        data_id = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  code = print(p1 / p2),\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: blue;\"),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")    \n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data_id aesthetic is critical to link observations between plots and the tooltip aesthetic is optional but nice to have when mouse over a point.\n\n\n\n2.2 Using plotly method for interactive data visualization\n\nPlotly’s R graphing library create interactive web graphics from ggplot2 graphs and/or a custom interface to the (MIT-licensed) JavaScript library plotly.js inspired by the grammar of graphics.\nDifferent from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n2.2.1 Using plot_ly\nCreating basic interactive scatterplot\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data,\n        x = ~MATHS,\n        y = ~ENGLISH,\n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the default color pallete to ColorBrewel colour palette\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH, \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising the color scheme manually\n\npal <- c(\"red\", \"purple\", \"blue\", \"green\")\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH, \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = pal)\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising tooltip\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH,\n        text = ~paste(\"Student ID:\", ID,     \n                      \"<br>Class:\", CLASS),  \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with layout. To learn more about layout, visit this link.\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH,\n        text = ~paste(\"Student ID:\", ID,     \n                      \"<br>Class:\", CLASS),  \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = \"Set1\") |> \n  \n  layout(title = 'English Score versus Maths Score',\n         xaxis = list(range = c(0,100)),\n         yaxis = list(range = c(0,100)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Using ggplotly\nCreating basic interactive scatterplot. With ggplotly, we can use the original ggplot2 and add ggplotly at the end as extra line\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(dotsize = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p) \n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Multiple Views using highlight_key and subplot of plotly package\n\nd <- highlight_key(exam_data)\n\np1 <- ggplot(data=d, \n              aes(x = MATHS,\n                  y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 <- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\n2.3 Using crosstalk method for interactive data visualization\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n2.3.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Linked brushing using crosstalk method\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.\n\n\nd <- highlight_key(exam_data)\n\np <- ggplot(data=d, \n              aes(x = MATHS,\n                  y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg <- highlight(ggplotly(p),\n                \"plotly_selected\")\n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,\n                  DT::datatable(d),\n                  widths = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Using gganimate method for creating animation\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\nImport data from the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook.\n\ncol <- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop <- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %>%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nBasic ggplot function to create static bubble plot\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  \n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  \n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\nBuilding animated bubble plot\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  \n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  \n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  \n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Using packed_bar method for visualizing large data interatively\nPacked bar aims to support the need of visualising skewed data over hundreds of categories.\nImporting data\n\nGDP <- read_csv(\"data/GDP.csv\")\nWorldCountry <- read_csv(\"data/WorldCountry.csv\")\n\nData preparation\n\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(Values = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  select(1:3, Values) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = `Series Name`,\n              values_from = `Values`) %>%\n  left_join(y=WorldCountry, by = c(\"Country Code\" = \"ISO-alpha3 Code\"))\n\nData preparation for packed bar\n\nGDP_selected_pb <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(GDP = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  filter(`Series Name` == \"GDP (current US$)\") %>%\n  select(1:2, GDP) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nIn the code chunk below, plotly_packed_bar() of rPackedBar package is used to create an interactive packed bar. Refer to this Vignettes and the user guide to learn more about the package.\n\np = plotly_packed_bar(\n  input_data = GDP_selected_pb,\n  label_column = \"Country Name\",\n  value_column = \"GDP\",\n  number_rows = 10,\n  plot_title = \"Top 10 countries by GDP, 2020\",\n  xaxis_label = \"GDP (US$)\",\n  hover_label = \"GDP\",\n  min_label_width = 0.018,\n  color_bar_color = \"#00aced\",\n  label_color = \"white\")\nplotly::config(p, displayModeBar = FALSE)"

    "text": "3. Discussion\nThis section discusses the reasoning behind decisions made in creating the visualization and patterns revealed by the analysis.\n\n3.1 Unequal population distribution by planning area\nBy choosing all the filters (Figure 2), we can roughly group the planning areas (PAs) to three different categories:\n\nNon-residential PAs\nLower populated PAs\nHigher populated PAs\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Displaying all PAs reveals unequal population distribution across planning areas\n\n\nThe first category would fall under non-residential zones, which are mainly used for either commercial (Downtown), industrial (Changi), or natural zone (Central Water Catchment). Note this does not necessarily mean zero population, areas like Downtown have small residential populations, most likely represented by high-end luxury apartments.\nThe second category (i.e., Jurong East, Kallang, Novena) could be explained by mixed-area land-uses or simply due to smaller PA size, while the last category (i.e., Sengkang, Tampines, Yishun) is full-fledged residential area. Figure 3 below shows the three distinct PA categories.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Three distinct PA categories revealed by the dashboard\n\n\nAs such, it makes sense to show the absolute population instead of percentage of PA population in the x-axis to showcase this unequal distribution. On top of that, we will exclude non-residential PAs from the analysis as they hold little significance.\n\n\n3.2 Different shapes of age-sex pyramids across PA\nFrom Figure 2 above, we can analyze not only the total population, but also the varying shapes of the pyramids across PAs. These pyramids have common features like thinning population at their pinnacles (eldest age-group) and thicker middle age-groups. However, there are notable differences as well.\nReferring to Figure 4 below, Bedok, Jurong West, and Ang Mo Kio pyramids are more rounded-shaped. Their highest age-group proportions lie around 50-70 years, with thinner population in other age-groups, indicating aging population.\nOn the other hand, Chua Chu Kang, Pasir Ris and Tampines still have high 50-70 years age-group population, but there is clear emerging young populations (20-35 years), making the pyramids look more like arrow-shaped. These trends are more prominent on the younger towns. Punggol is an extreme case with highly accentuated 35-45 and 5-10 years age groups.\nSome unique cases like Sembawang and Toa Payoh offer unexpectedly high 30-35 age-group, which almost looks like outliers, making the pyramids look jagged.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Analyzing different shapes of age-sex pyramids\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Gender Ratio on each PA is relatively constant\nChoosing the 9 most populated PAs reveal relatively constant gender ratio on each PA, despite different shapes of the pyramids. This is accentuated in Figure 5 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Nine most populated PA age-sex pyramids\n\n\nTo illustrate this, we can examine Jurong West and Punggol age-sex pyramids closely. Jurong West pyramids look rounded. Meanwhile, Punggol has a completely different arrow-shaped pyramid. Despite these differences, the proportion of male vs female population remains rather constant for different age groups (mirror-image across central axis). This observation is quite consistent across different PAs chosen.\nIt is noted, however, that at the higher age group, there tend to be more females than males. This is shown most clearly in Bedok (90 and over) with 1440 females vs 660 males. Combining this information with relatively uniform gender-ratio at the lower age group, this could be explained by higher life expectancy of females.\nRegardless, this trend was also observed in Figure 4 as well. Hence it was decided to select Figure 4 as the default PA filter as it highlights variations in pyramid shapes and total population."

    "text": "2. Data Visualization Critique\n\n2.1 Original Design\nFigure 1 below shows the original design of the Singapore population pyramid by Planning Area in June 2022.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Original design of age-sex pyramid prepared by peer in Take Home Exercise 1 using Tableau\n\n\nThe link to the actual dashboard can be accessed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Critique : Clarity and Aesthetics\n\nClarity\n\nWhile Tableau displays dynamic chart, the lack of x-axis in the plot makes it difficult to gauge the male and female population. This also potentially misleads audience as it wrongly presents different planning areas having comparable population size (i.e., population size of Downtown Core is much smaller than Tampines, but the length of the bars show that they are similar). This is because the scales of x-axis for different pyramids (in different planning areas) are inconsistent.\nLack of legend, making it difficult to determine which side represents Male or Female population. Note that traditionally, the Male population is on the left side of the pyramids, hence initially creating confusion between color and position without legend.\nThe title is descriptive, but not specific. For instance, it does not tell the audience which period was this from. Additionally, it does not tell the audience the context of the visualization (i.e., main highlight, story, etc). A well-worded title and subtitle should help here.\nThe original data age group binning (5 years) was kept. This is good as it keeps the resolution, grouping this to lower resolution (i.e., 10 years) might lead to detail loss. However, this leads to audience having to scroll down on each individual pyramid, making it difficult to observe patterns from quick glance.\nLack of references for audience to compare across different facets, having relevant data labels or reference line would improve readability.\nThe presence of grid lines without x-axis is meaningless as there is no reference point.\nThe order of the planning areas in the trellis chart is not meaningful.\nLack of caption to present the source of data.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nGood color choices representing Male and Female population, making it easy to read.\nClear planning area labels for each population pyramid.\nUniform white background gives a clean look.\nSoft grid lines are not distracting.\nY-axis labels are not very easy to read due to presence of ‘_’."

    "text": "3. Makeover Design\n\n3.1 Proposed Sketch\nFrom the original visualization, it seems that the original author intends to contrast different population sizes and patterns across Singapore planning areas. This might be the reason for presenting low populated area like “Downtown Core” and highly populated area like “Tampines” together. One way to do this is to plot the absolute pyramids (based on actual population) of the original planning areas, ordered based on population sizes. Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Proposed sketch of the first plot\n\n\nAnother angle of visualizing age-sex pyramids is by plotting the proportion pyramids (based on proportion% of population). This will highlight the population patterns better without being influenced by the population size. With this, we could also add reference chart based on Singapore overall population proportion %. It is also important to have data labels highlighting the population of each planning area to still highlight the differences in population sizes.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Proposed sketch of the second plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Data Preparation\nLaunch R packages and import data from csv using readr::read_csv().\nThe packages installed are tidyverse, cowplot and scales. While tidyverse contains all useful R packages used for cleaning data and plotting graph, cowplot is ggplot2 extension, providing professional-looking figure. scales helps to add comma and/or percentage for labels display. patchwork is used to combine the two visualizations. All packages can be found within CRAN.\n\n\nShow the code\n#Load packages\npacman::p_load(cowplot, scales, patchwork, tidyverse)\n\n#Import data\nsgpop <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesextod2022.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\nModifying the loaded data\n\nGroup the original data by planning area (PA), age group (AG), and gender (Sex) using dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarise(), deriving new variable called sum_pop, which is the sum of population grouped by the three variables mentioned. dplyr::ungroup() is used to avoid further complications.\nConvert Males population to negative to reverse the bar chart axis using dplyr::mutate() and ifelse.\nEliminate the ‘_’, ‘to’, ‘and over’ in age group (AG) using dplyr::mutate() and gsub().\nDerive variables min_pop and max_pop to determine the min and max male & female population values for each planning area (PA) across age group (AG). This will be used in conjunction with signal below for data labeling purpose.\nDerive new variables to calculate population proportion : sum of population by PA (sum_pop_pa), sum of population by age and sex (sum_pop_total), sum of total Singapore population (sum_pop_total_sg)\nUsing left_join() to create new clean tibble called sgpop_clean which will be used as final dataset for plotting\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Data Cleaning\n#sgpop_group groups total population by PA, AG, and Sex to create base data for population pyramid\nsgpop_group <- sgpop |> \n  mutate(AG = gsub('_to_',' - ', AG),\n         AG = gsub('_and_over', '+', AG),\n         Pop = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", Pop*(-1), Pop)) |>\n  group_by(PA, AG, Sex) |> \n  summarise(sum_pop = sum(Pop)) |> \n  ungroup()\n\n#sgpop_max_min creates summary parameters for max, min, and sum by grouping them on PA and Sex.

As such forcats::fct_relevel() is used to order them manually.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#adding new variables:\n#signal is used to display labels for min and max values in population pyramid\n#prop_pop is proportion population per planning area\n#prop_pop_total is proportion population of Singapore\nsgpop_clean <- sgpop_clean |> \n  mutate(signal = case_when((min_pop == abs(sum_pop) | max_pop == abs(sum_pop)) &\n                              Sex == \"Males\" ~ -1,\n                            (min_pop == abs(sum_pop) | max_pop == abs(sum_pop)) &\n                              Sex == \"Females\" ~ 1,\n                            TRUE~0),\n         prop_pop = round(sum_pop/sum_pop_pa*100, 1),\n         prop_pop_total = abs(round(sum_pop_total/sum_pop_total_sg*100, 1))\n         )\n\n#Order factors\nsgpop_clean$Sex <- fct_relevel(sgpop_clean$Sex, \"Males\")\nsgpop_clean$AG  <- fct_relevel(sgpop_clean$AG, \"0 - 4\", \"5 - 9\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Creating functions to plot the charts\nFunctions are used to plot the charts to give flexibility to user(s) to input their selected 9 planning areas, ordered by their preference. In this case, however, we will use the original 9 planning areas in the original design.\n\nThe multiple layers of the visualization function\n\nVariable PA needs to be ordered to ensure that it appears as intended when plotting the trellis chart. As such forcats::fct_reorder() is used to order them by population size (sum_pop_pa).\nggplot2::geom_col() to plot the pyramids. This is used instead of ggplot2::geom_bar() as we are plotting the values in the data instead of frequency of occurrence.\nAdding labels on min and max values is achieved using ggplot2::geom_text(). The variable signal is used here to determine whether the labels appear or not. The signal is multiplied by certain value to give certain distance from the end of the bar.\nOnly for second plot, ggplot2::geom_step() is used to create the dashed reference line representing Singapore overall population proportion (%).\nCustomise legend and color using ggplot2::scale_fill_manual().\nCustomise x-axis (population) scales using ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(). Note that we are not using ggplot2::scale_x_continuous() as we used ggplot2::coord_flip() before. Reason for this is because ggplot2::geom_step() is unable to plot categorical variables in y-axis.\nTo customise the title, subtitle, and caption, ggplot2::labs() is used.\nTrellis plot is created using ggplot2::facet_wrap(). Note that we are not using ggplot2::facet_grid() as we are creating the facets using one variable - PA.\nLabels for “Total Population” for each planning area is created using ggplot2::geom_label() to add nice border around the text.\ncowplot::theme_cowplot() is used to create more clean and professional look. Other theme adjustments utilise ggplot2::theme().\n\n\n\nCreating the two functions\n\nFunction plot_PA_pop is created to plot age-sex pyramids based on absolute population.

patterns across Singapore planning areas. As such absolute age-sex pyramids are plotted in 3x3 trellis chart. The reason for choosing 3x3 is to fit the display in one screen webpage (using quarto). Having 9x1 or 1x9 will either require audience to scroll or squeeze the pyramids too closely together.\n\n\nShow the code\n#Calling the function to plot absolute population pyramid by the nine planning areas selected by peer\np1 <- plot_PA_pop(c(\"Changi\", \"Downtown Core\", \"Newton\", \"Bukit Timah\",\"Clementi\", \"Sembawang\", \"Serangoon\", \"Hougang\", \"Tampines\"))\np1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second plot presents an alternative angle to the same planning areas, highlighting the population patterns better without being influenced by the population size. Reference chart based on Singapore overall population proportion % is added to allow audience to see how different planning areas population patterns differ from national proportion. Note that the reference chart is only possible to be added in the second plot as putting this in first plot will overshadow individual planning area pyramids. This is due to sheer size of Singapore population relative to each planning area. The two versions of the second plot is presented below.\n\nRepresenting Singapore population proportion % with reference-step line\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Calling the function to plot proportion population pyramid by the nine planning areas selected by peer\np2a <- plot_PA_prop(c(\"Changi\", \"Downtown Core\", \"Newton\", \"Bukit Timah\",\"Clementi\", \"Sembawang\", \"Serangoon\", \"Hougang\", \"Tampines\"))\np2a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresenting Singapore population proportion % with reference bar chart\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Calling the function to plot proportion population pyramid by the nine planning areas selected by peer\np2b <- plot_PA_prop_bar(c(\"Changi\", \"Downtown Core\", \"Newton\", \"Bukit Timah\",\"Clementi\", \"Sembawang\", \"Serangoon\", \"Hougang\", \"Tampines\"))\np2b\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that it is quite difficult to see the reference bar chart, especially for certain planning areas like Clementi or Hougang, in which there is large overlap with overall Singapore Population pyramid. As such it might make sense to use the step chart instead as the final visualization.\n\nFinal Visualization\nThe final visualization is created using patchwork to stitch the two plots together. This will put the two trellis charts side-by-side, showcasing the different angles brought about by the two plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Calling the function to plot proportion population pyramid by the nine planning areas selected by peer\nfinal_plot <- p1 + p2a\nfinal_plot + plot_annotation(\n  title = 'Population sizes differ drastically across Singapore planning areas, however its pattern differences are further revealed with proportion pyramid (%)',\n  subtitle = paste0(\"Singapore age-sex pyramids by Planning Area, June 2022\\nTotal Singapore Residents Population : \",comma(sgpop_clean$sum_pop_total_sg),\"\\nReference step chart (dashed line) on Plot 2 represents Singapore overall population proportion (%)\"),\n  caption = \"Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 from Department of Statistics, Singapore\",\n  theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24),\n                plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarity Improvements\n\nConsistent scale of x-axis allows fair comparisons of population size and patterns across different planning areas. This is especially important since the population sizes for different planning areas differ greatly.\nAs ggplot2 plots a static chart, having grid lines are important for audience for referencing. In this case, both y and x-axis grid lines are kept to ease readability, allowing audience to refer even the furthest pyramid from the axis (top right pyramid).\nLegend is provided and the “Male” bar chart is put to the left, allowing faster recognition.\nThe title describes the context of the visualization, which is to contrast population sizes and patterns across different planning areas. Subtitle also provides factual clarity of the plots with total population displayed as reference.\nBy adjusting the plot height, the solutions presented still keep the original resolution (5-year), without audience having to scroll down on each individual facet. This eases comparison among all pyramids in one view.\nOnly data labels for min and max population across age groups for each planning areas are provided. This gives reference for audience without overwhelming them with too much text labels.\nAnnotations on each facets highlighting the total population for different planning areas gives an anchor point for audience, further spotlighting the context (different population sizes) of visualization.\nReference chart of second plot adds another dimension of comparison for audience.\nThe planning area is ordered by population sizes, allowing audience to contrast the pyramid sizes per row (for the first plot)\nCaption is provided to present the source of data.\n\n\n\nAesthetics Improvements\n\nSoft solid grid lines are not distracting.\nReference chart is in step chart to mimic the shape of population pyramids. It is also dashed to better distinguish from the grid lines. As discussed above, this offers better overall visualization than the transparent bar charts.\nTick-marks for y-axis (age group) are removed as they are superfluous for categorical variables.\nThe y-axis label “Age Group” is removed as the subtitle already describes it as age-sex pyramids."

However it requires the students to use ggplot2, its extensions, and tidyverse packages instead of Tableau. It also adds another dimension of critique and makeover of peer works which helps to embed best practices in data visualization. The key takeaways are:\n\nIt is important to start by questioning the purpose and intent of the visualization. By understanding this, one can start experimenting and designing the apt visualization from different dimensions. One example would be the second plot produced in this exercise, looking at the age-sex pyramid from the population proportion (%) rather than absolute values.\nThere is no best visualization as there might be some trade-offs between clarity and aesthetics. Adding horizontal (y-axis) grid lines in this chart presented me with a dilemma as it reduces aesthetics (by cluttering the plots), but adds additional clarity, assisting the audience to refer to the age group. This is particularly important for static visualization like this.\nLearning to critique other peer’s works help to identify pain points, to understand best practices, and to awaken new ideas that were not surfaced during Take-home Exercise 1."

Visualisation\n\n3.1 Exploratory Data Visualisation\nThe plots here are preliminary in nature but designed with interactivity to allow users to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualisation to study the data. Hence plotly is mainly used.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1. Interactive scatterplot\n\nDesign Consideration\nScatterplots are generally used to discover relationship between two continuous variables. As such, the visualization below allows users to select the x-axis and y-axis of the continuous variables they wish to study. Considerations :\n\nDropdown menu to select variables for y-axis and x-axis\ny-axis selection is resale_price and resale_price_persqm. This is aligned with the study purpose of discovering patterns of resale price. This allows users to also see the intent of normalising resale_price by floor_area_sqm\nx-axis selection is other continuous variables, namely: remaining_lease_years, lease_commence_date, and floor_area_sqm\nAs the plots are expected to be very cluttered, opacity is introduced with white border\nTooltip indicating variables of interest : remaining_lease_years, floor_area_sqm, and resale_price_persqm\n\n\n\nPreparation of visualisation\nplot_ly is used to prepare the interactive plot. Steps taken are\n\nInitiating base scatterplot, indicated by type = 'scatter'. marker argument is used to introduce opacity and line (white plot border)\nTooltip customisation is created using hovertemplate argument\nlayout argument is used to add plot title, x-axis title, and y-axis title\nTo create the dropdown menu for parameters of x-axis and y-axis, the updatemenus argument is used to create respective buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nupdatemenus argument takes a list of list of arguments detailing the type, direction, and position of the menus. Additionally, it has buttons argument that takes another list of list of arguments detailing the method, args (x-axis/y-axis variable), and labels. Note that update is chosen in method as we want to modify data and layout attributes.

Hence the decision to normalize the resale price is justified. From here onwards, we will focus more on resale price per sqm.\nPlotting resale price per sqm vs remaining lease reveals somewhat positive exponential correlation. There seems to sharper increase in gradient if the remaining lease is beyond 80 years\nAs expected, the same pattern is revealed when resale price per sqm is plotted against the year of lease commenced.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = flatpriceclean)+\n\n  geom_point(aes(x = lease_commence_date,\n                 y = remaining_lease_years)) +\n  \n  labs(\n    x = \"Year of Lease Commenced\",\n    y = \"Remaining Lease\\n(Year)\") +\n\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nReferring to the graph above, year of lease commenced and remaining lease are directly correlated to each other as shown in above plot. Hence it makes sense to use one of them in future analysis. In this case, we will only use remaining lease as it is more intuitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2. Interactive boxviolin plot\n\nDesign Consideration\nIn contrast to scatterplots, boxplots are generally used to discover relationship between continuous variables and discrete variables. Violin plots can also be added to visualize the kernel density of the data.\nAs such, the visualization below allows users to select the x-axis of the discrete variables they wish to study. Considerations :\n\nDropdown menu to select variables for x-axis\ny-axis selected is resale_price_persqm. This is aligned with the study purpose of discovering patterns of resale price\nx-axis selection is the discrete variables, namely: flat_type, flat_model, storey_range, town, and month. Note that month (transaction month) is treated as discrete variable as we want to find out any seasonal variations (statistically significant difference in mean/median) of price.\nx-axis title is omitted as it will be displayed by the selected dropdown menu\nCombining boxplots and violin plots to visualize the quartiles and kernel density of the distribution\nTooltip to show mean, quartiles, and outliers\nPlot can be zoomed-in or out as it might be difficult to get details with large number of categories (i.e., town)\nOrder the variables by ascending order (mean) if they are not lexicographically important (i.e., flat_type, storey_range, and month\n\n\n\nPreparation of visualisation\nplot_ly is used to prepare the interactive plot. Steps taken are\n\nInitiating base scatterplot, indicated by type = 'violin'. Note box visible argument is set to T to ensure the boxplot is visible. The same is applied to meanline visible to ensure meanline is visible in color \"rgb(231, 99, 250)\"\nSet the opacity of the dots to 0.5 and the color of the meanline to dark pink to improve visualisation\nlayout argument is used to add plot title, and y-axis title\nTo create the dropdown menu for parameters of x-axis, the updatemenus argument is used to create respective buttons\ncategoryorder is set for each button to determine the order of discrete variables. category ascending will ensure lexicographic order while mean ascending will ensure mean order.\n\nRefer to code below for more details\n\n\nShow the code\n#Initiating the base plot\nplot_ly(data = flatpriceclean,\n        x = ~flat_type,\n        y = ~resale_price_persqm,\n        line = list(width =1),\n        type = \"violin\",\n        marker = list(opacity = 0.5,\n          line = list(width = 2)),\n        box = list(visible = T),\n        meanline = list(visible = T,\n                        color = \"rgb(231, 99, 250)\")) |> \n  \n#Generating plot and y-axis title  \n  layout(title = \"Distribution of resale price by selected factors \\nResale transactions, 2022\",\n         xaxis = list(title = \"\"),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Resale Price per sqm (SGD)\"),\n         \n#creating dropwdown menus to allow selection of parameters on x-axis \n         updatemenus = list(list(type = 'dropdown',\n                                 xref = \"paper\",\n                                 yref = \"paper\",\n                                 xanchor = \"left\",\n                                 x = 0.04, \n                                 y = 0.95,\n                                 buttons = list(\n                                   list(method = \"update\",\n                                        args = list(list(x = list(flatpriceclean$flat_type)),\n                                                    list(xaxis = list(categoryorder = \"category ascending\"))),\n                                        label = \"Flat Type\"),\n                                   list(method = \"update\",\n                                        args = list(list(x = list(flatpriceclean$flat_model)),\n                                                    list(xaxis = list(categoryorder = \"mean ascending\"))),\n                                        label = \"Flat Model\"),\n                                   list(method = \"update\",\n                                        args = list(list(x = list(flatpriceclean$storey_range)),\n                                                    list(xaxis = list(categoryorder = \"category ascending\"))),\n                                        label = \"Storey Height\"),\n                                   list(method = \"update\",\n                                        args = list(list(x = list(flatpriceclean$town)),\n                                                    list(xaxis = list(categoryorder = \"mean ascending\"))),\n                                        label = \"Town\"),\n                                   list(method = \"update\",\n                                        args = list(list(x = list(flatpriceclean$month)),\n                                                    list(xaxis = list(tickmode = \"array\")),\n                                                    list(color = list(flatpriceclean$month))),\n                                        label = \"Transaction Month\")\n                              \n                                   )\n                                 )\n                            )\n         )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSelect the relevant x-variable (groups) in the dropdown box in the graph above to study the boxviolin plot of resale price per area by different groups\n\n\n\n\nInsights\nNote that insights can be garnered by zooming in some plots with high number of categories\n\nWhen plotted by flat_type, preliminary EDA reveals minimal difference between the means/medians. This is expected since we are using resale_price_persqm. Note that flats with more rooms tend to be bigger in area, hence when normalized by area, the difference in resale price among different types of flat is minimized. It is interesting to note that 5 ROOM flat type has the lowest mean overall.\nWhen plotted by flat_model, preliminary EDA reveals higher mean/median resale_price_persqm for models like DBSS, Terrace, Premium, S2 and S1. However, it is important to note that these types tend to be few in the market as well. Note large variance are observed for improved and Model A types.\nWhen plotted by storey_range, preliminary EDA reveals higher mean/median resale_price_persqm for higher storey. Note large outliers are observed for 19 to 27th storey units.\nWhen plotted by town, preliminary EDA reveals differences in mean/median resale_price_persqm for different town estates. At the lower end, we can find newly developed or further towns (i.e., Woodlands, Pasir Ris, Jurong West), while at the opposite end, we find more mature or centrally located towns (i.e., Central Area, Queenstown, Kallang/Whampoa). Note that the data looks skewed right with most of the towns’ means are higher than the medians and high presence of outlier on the higher end.\nPreliminary EDA reveals minimal difference in resale_price_persqm between transaction months.\n\nHowever, these observations need to be confirmed using appropriate hypothesis techniques. Since the focus of the study is on resale price by residential towns, only this will be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Confirmatory Data Analysis Visualisation\nThe plots here are focused in visual statistical testing used in Confirmatory Data Analysis. Hence ggstatsplot is mainly used.\n\nNormality Assumption\nBefore performing the necessary hypothesis testing, we need to choosen between parametric and non-parametric test. As such nortest::ad.test() will be used to perform Anderson-Darling test with confidence level of 95% to test the null hypothesis that the resale price per area by town is normally distributed.\nfor-loop is used to iterate through each unique town to create a list called normaltestlist containing a list of Anderson-Darling test results. A tibble called normaltest is then created containing the town variable and p_value result of the Anderson-Darling test. DT::datatable() is then used to create interactive data table.\nRefer to code below for more details\n\nnormaltestlist <- list()\nfor (i in unique(flatpriceclean$town)){\n  subdf <- subset(x = flatpriceclean, subset=town==i)\n  normaltestlist[[i]] <- nortest::ad.test(subdf$resale_price_persqm)\n}\n\nnormaltest <- tibble(town = unique(flatpriceclean$town),\n                        p_value = unlist(lapply(normaltestlist, `[[`, 2)))\n\nDT::datatable(normaltest, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBased on the result above, the null hypothesis is rejected as some of the distributions are below 0.05 critical value. As such, we are not able to confirm normality assumption for distribution of resale price per area by town.\n\n\n\n\nDesign Consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSince we are unable to confirm normality assumption, non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis) will be used for hypothesis testing. Note that the null hypothesis is no difference between median resale price per area by towns/estates.\n\n\nTo ensure that best practices (APA standard) of statistical reporting is followed, ggstatsplot library is used in this section. Considerations :\n\nAs revealed by EDA, town variables have 26 categories. Hence ggbetweenstats will be used for one-way ANOVA testing.\nMedian is used instead of mean as point estimates due to high presence of outliers and skewness of data. This will also complement the non-parametric test as well.\nGiven the large number of categories, two plots are considered, splitting the towns seeing >= 850 transactions and those seeing <850 transactions in 2022. This is mainly to ensure that the selected towns can fit in single plot (13 towns each) as having 26 towns in one single plot causes it to be too cluttered. This also helps to reduce bias against variations in number of observations. Note that the y-axis range needs to be fixed for the two plots for easier comparison.\n\n\n\nPreparation of visualisation\nggstatsplot is used to prepare the plot. Steps taken are\n\nOrder the towns by the median of resale_price_persqm in ascending order using forcats::fct_reorder. This will ensure the towns are ordered accordingly for easier observation.\nggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats() is used to display the one-way ANOVA plot. Note that the dataset is grouped by town and filtered when count >=850. This is achieved using dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::filter()\nAs above design consideration, non-parametric test is considered hence type = \"np\"\nComparisons are made pairwise between non-significant pairs as they are the points of interest. Note that the majority of the pairs comparison are significant as well, hence it will clutter the plots unnecessarily if significant pairwise comparison is displayed. The argument pairwise.display = \"ns\"\nTwo plots are created and assigned to p1 and p2 respectively\nTwo sets of color are manually provided using scale_color_manual of ggplot2. This is because the basic palette is not able to support large number of colors (26)\nscale_y_continuous is used to set the y-axis range between 4,000 and 20,000\npatchwork is added to combine the two plots using operator /\nplot_annotation() is used to configure the title, subtitle and caption of the combined visualisation\n\nRefer to code below for more details\n\n\nShow the code\n#Order the town variables by median of resale price\nflatpriceclean$town <- fct_reorder(flatpriceclean$town, flatpriceclean$resale_price_persqm, median)\n\n#set the color pallete\ncol13_1 <- c(\"dodgerblue2\", \"#E31A1C\", \n  \"green4\",\n  \"#6A3D9A\", \n  \"#FF7F00\", \n  \"gray30\", \"gold1\",\n  \"skyblue2\", \"#FB9A99\", \n  \"palegreen2\",\n  \"#CAB2D6\", \n  \"#FDBF6F\", \n  \"gray80\") \n  \ncol13_2 <- c(\"khaki2\",\n  \"maroon\", \"orchid1\", \"deeppink1\", \"blue1\", \"steelblue4\",\n  \"darkturquoise\", \"green1\", \"yellow4\", \"yellow3\",\n  \"darkorange4\", \"brown\", \"gray50\")\n\n#Initiating the base plot\np1 <- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = flatpriceclean|> \n    group_by(town) |> \n    filter(n() >= 850),\n  x = town, \n  y = resale_price_persqm, \n  ylab = \"Resale Price per sqm (SGD)\",\n  title = \"Plot 1.

For each plot, they hypothesis is:\n\nH0 : There is no difference between median resale price per flat area across towns\nH1 : There is difference between median resale price per flat area across towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSince the p-value < critical value of 0.05, there is statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that for each group of towns (grouped by number of transactions), there is difference between median resale price per flat area.\n\n\nIn both plots, it can be observed that there are few pairs of towns with p-value > 0.05 such as Jurong West and Choa Chu Kang. This suggests that the differences between the medians of the pair are not statistically significant.\nWe can also observe that there is overall higher median and higher number of towns with significant outliers (i.e., Central Area, Queenstown, Toa Payoh, Bishan, Clementi) in the second plot (towns with < 850 transactions).\nOverall, the findings of the EDA is more or less consistent (refer to section 3.1.2 above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Visualising the uncertainty of point estimates\nIt is tempting to interpret point estimate like median as precise representation of the true data value. However, it is worth noting that there are uncertainties surrounding the point estimates, hence the motivation to display the the target quantile confidence levels (95% or 99%) that the true (unknown) estimate would lie within the interval, given the evidence provided by the observed data.\n\nDesign Consideration\nggdist::stat_pointinterval() is used to visualise the uncertainty. Considerations :\n\nMedian point estimates are used instead of mean due to high presence of outliers and skewness of data. With this, user can still relate to the above one-way ANOVA analysis\nWith median used as point estimate, quantile interval is used instead of confidence interval\n95% and 99% intervals are used as they are commonly associated with 5% and 1% error rate, which are commonly used in hypothesis testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe aim is to provide one-glance of levels of uncertainties of median estimate of resale price by town. Hence there is no need to clutter the plot with too much details (i.e., labels and annotations) and it is possible to present this in a single plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is important to use quantile interval for median point estimates instead of using typical confidence intervals. As with all nonparametric confidence intervals, the exact confidence level is not always attainable but the level which is exact to the interval constructed is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of visualisation\nggplot2 and stat_pointinterval() are used to prepare the plot. Steps taken are\n\nUse the base ggplot() to determine the data and x, y-variables\nDefine confidence levels in width argument of stat_pointinterval(). Define the .point estimate as median and .interval as qi (quantile intervals). The argument point_color also assigns color to the point.\nscale_color_manual() of ggplot2 is used to assign colors for the interval lines (95% and 99%). Note that the colors chosen are only slightly different, just enough to distinguish the closely related interval lines.\nSetting the title, subtitle and caption using lab() and theme() of ggplot2\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Base ggplot\nggplot(\n  data = flatpriceclean,\n  aes(x = town,\n      y = resale_price_persqm)) +\n  \n#Using stat_pointinterval to plot the points and intervals\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(level)),\n    .width = c(0.95, 0.99),\n    .point = median,\n    .interval = qi,\n    point_color = \"darkred\",\n    show.legend = FALSE) +\n\n#Defining the color of the intervals \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue2\", \"darkblue\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n#Title, subtitle, and caption\n  labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of resale price by town',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of resale price per flat area by Town, 2022',\n  caption = 'Resale flat princes based on registration date from Jan-2017 onwards from data.gov.sg',\n  x = \"Planning Town\",\n  y = \"Resale Price per sqm (SGD)\") +\n  \n  theme_hc() +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\nAs noted above, some towns like Central Area, Bukit Merah, and Bishan have higher uncertainties. This could be potentially due to large presence of outliers in those towns, more varied flat types or models. On the opposite spectrum, towns like Choa Chu Kang, Sembawang and Bukit Timah have lower uncertainties, which might indicate lower presence of outliers or more uniform flat types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Visualisation of Resale Price vs Remaining Lease by Township\nSection 3.1 above allow users to perform EDA to explore the relationship between resale price with other variables. Section 3.2 confirms statistical evidence of difference of resale price by towns. It is hence interesting to combine these insights together in one interactive visualization.\n\nDesign Consideration\nOne of the most interesting finding in EDA in Section 3.1.1 is the relationship between resale price per sqm and remaining lease_years. Unfortunately, without applying any filters, there is very little insight that can be garnered from this two-dimensional plot. Additional dimensions could be introduced by applying town filter, which was found to be statistically significant in Section 3.2. Considerations:\n\nInteractive bubble plots of resale_price per sqm and remaining_lease_years\nDropdown menu to filter by town. Note that introduction of this filter not only helps users to visualise the different aspects of the bubble plot per town, but also reduces cluttering by too many datapoints.\nThe bubbles can be colored by flat_type and its size corresponds to the floor_area_sqm. The flat_type is chosen for color as it has the least number of categories, avoiding cluttering the plot with too many colors. The size corresponds to the floor_area_sqm to align with user’s intuition that bigger bubble means bigger size. While the resale price is already normalized against this, users can also see different angle given with remaining_lease_years in the x-axis. Note that with plot_ly, the color legend can also be selected/deselected to apply additional filter\nTo reduce cluttering further, opacity is introduced with white border\nTooltip indicating other important variables : resale_price_persqm, floor_area_sqm, remaining_lease_years, flat_model, and storey_range\n\n\n\nPreparation of visualisation\nFirstly, each unique instance of town was defined using for-loop. This will create a list within list (town_list) containing the method, args, and label arguments of each town. This list will be used as an input to buttons argument of the updatemenus. The annotation variables (annot) for the dropdown menu was also defined.\nRefer to code below for more details\n\ntown_list <- list()\nfor (i in 1:length(unique(flatpriceclean$town))) { \n  town_list[[i]] <- list(method = \"restyle\",\n                         args = list(\"transforms[0].value\",\n                                     unique(flatpriceclean$town)[i]),\n                         label = unique(flatpriceclean$town)[i])\n  }\n\nannot <- list(list(text = \"Planning Town:\",\n                   x = 1.41,\n                   y = 0.78,\n                   xref = 'paper',\n                   yref = 'paper',\n                   showarrow = FALSE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is useful to pre-define complicated list input to buttons argument of updatemenus outside the plot function. This will improve code readability drastically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that restyle is used in method argument as we want to modify data or data attributes and not the layout of the plot. Refer to here for additional information.\n\n\nplot_ly() is used to prepare the interactive bubble plot. Steps taken are\n\nflatpriceorder variable is created to ensure that there is no clash between the color and transforms argument in plot_ly.\nInitiating base scatterplot, indicated by type = 'scatter'. marker argument is used to introduce opacity and line (white plot border).

Interesting insights:\n\nThe fixed reference frame (x-axis and y-axis range) allows users to see the lower resale price in Woodlands vs higher resale price in Kallang\nOne can also discern how newer estates like Punggol fetch relatively low resale price (<8kSGD) per sqm despite having > 80 years remaining lease. This is in comparison with Central Area which can fetch up to 14kSGD per sqm for the same remaining lease. This highlights the importance of town centrality in resale price\nIn a more mature estates like Bedok, Toa Payoh, or Queenstown, the older flats tend to be predominantly dominated by 3-room flats, fetching lower resale price. Between 60-80 years remaining lease, they are dominated by 4 & 5-room flats. Interestingly, beyond 80 years remaining lease, there are significant numbers of 3-room flats sold fetching competitive price."

In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",   #placement of the axis label\n               diag = \"l\",      #specify glyph on the principal diagonal\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,  #input the calculated conf.level\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n\n#ordering using AOE\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n#ordering using hierarchical clustering using ward\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nReview the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package.\nUser manualof the package\nBasic heatmap using heatmaply, excluding column 1,2,4,5\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1,2,4,5)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering\nManual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nUse dend_expend() to determine the recommended clustering method with Euclidean distance\n\nwh_d <- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output above shows that average method should be used as it gives the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster. Figure below shows k = 3 is optimal\n\nwh_clust <- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k <- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\nUsing above results, plot using heatmaply()\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriation\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nDifferent algorithms : Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO), Gruvaeus and Wainer (GW), or “mean” which gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2. The option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix. Example:\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting all together\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          \n          #cluster k = 5\n          k_row = 5,\n          \n          #change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          \n          #change fontsize for row and column labels\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

We will use lubridate::ymd_hms() and lubridate::hour() to format the time. weekdays() is a base R function.\n\nmake_hr_wkday <- function(ts, sc, tz){\n  real_times <- ymd_hms(ts,\n                        tz = tz[1],\n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt <- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n}\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\nNote: Convert the wkday and hour fields into factor to ensure ordering\n\nwkday_levels <- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks <- attacks |> \n  group_by(tz) |> \n  \n  #call the function in Step 2.2.1\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp,\n                   .$source_country,\n                   .$tz)) |> \n  \n  ungroup() |> \n  mutate(wkday = factor(wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n         hour = factor(hour, levels = 0:23)\n  )\n\nVisualising the tidy tibble table after processing\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Building Calendar Heatmap\n\n2.3.1 Basic calendar heatmap\n\n#Building grouped by aggregating attacks by wkday and hour fields.
