    "text": "3. Discussion\nThis section discusses the reasoning behind decisions made in creating the visualization and patterns revealed by the analysis.\n\n3.1 Unequal population distribution by planning area\nBy choosing all the filters (Figure 2), we can roughly group the planning areas (PAs) to three different categories:\n\nNon-residential PAs\nLower populated PAs\nHigher populated PAs\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Displaying all PAs reveals unequal population distribution across planning areas\n\n\nThe first category would fall under non-residential zones, which are mainly used for either commercial (Downtown), industrial (Changi), or natural zone (Central Water Catchment). Note this does not necessarily mean zero population, areas like Downtown have small residential populations, most likely represented by high-end luxury apartments.\nThe second category (i.e., Jurong East, Kallang, Novena) could be explained by mixed-area land-uses or simply due to smaller PA size, while the last category (i.e., Sengkang, Tampines, Yishun) is full-fledged residential area. Figure 3 below shows the three distinct PA categories.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Three distinct PA categories revealed by the dashboard\n\n\nAs such, it makes sense to show the absolute population instead of percentage of PA population in the x-axis to showcase this unequal distribution. On top of that, we will exclude non-residential PAs from the analysis as they hold little significance.\n\n\n3.2 Different shapes of age-sex pyramids across PA\nFrom Figure 2 above, we can analyze not only the total population, but also the varying shapes of the pyramids across PAs. These pyramids have common features like thinning population at their pinnacles (eldest age-group) and thicker middle age-groups. However, there are notable differences as well.\nReferring to Figure 4 below, Bedok, Jurong West, and Ang Mo Kio pyramids are more rounded-shaped. Their highest age-group proportions lie around 50-70 years, with thinner population in other age-groups, indicating aging population.\nOn the other hand, Chua Chu Kang, Pasir Ris and Tampines still have high 50-70 years age-group population, but there is clear emerging young populations (20-35 years), making the pyramids look more like arrow-shaped. These trends are more prominent on the younger towns. Punggol is an extreme case with highly accentuated 35-45 and 5-10 years age groups.\nSome unique cases like Sembawang and Toa Payoh offer unexpectedly high 30-35 age-group, which almost looks like outliers, making the pyramids look jagged.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Analyzing different shapes of age-sex pyramids\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Gender Ratio on each PA is relatively constant\nChoosing the 9 most populated PAs reveal relatively constant gender ratio on each PA, despite different shapes of the pyramids. This is accentuated in Figure 5 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Nine most populated PA age-sex pyramids\n\n\nTo illustrate this, we can examine Jurong West and Punggol age-sex pyramids closely. Jurong West pyramids look rounded. Meanwhile, Punggol has a completely different arrow-shaped pyramid. Despite these differences, the proportion of male vs female population remains rather constant for different age groups (mirror-image across central axis). This observation is quite consistent across different PAs chosen.\nIt is noted, however, that at the higher age group, there tend to be more females than males. This is shown most clearly in Bedok (90 and over) with 1440 females vs 660 males. Combining this information with relatively uniform gender-ratio at the lower age group, this could be explained by higher life expectancy of females.\nRegardless, this trend was also observed in Figure 4 as well. Hence it was decided to select Figure 4 as the default PA filter as it highlights variations in pyramid shapes and total population."

This also potentially mislead audience as it wrongly presents different planning areas have similar population size (i.e., population size of Downtown Core is much smaller than Tampines, but the length of the bars show that they are similar). This is because the scales of x-axis for different pyramids are inconsistent.\nLack of legends, making it difficult to determine which side represents Male or Female population.\nThe title is descriptive, but not specific. For instance, it does not tell the audience which period was this from. Additionally, it does not tell the audience the context of the visualization (i.e., main highlight, story, etc). A well-worded title and subtitle should help here.\nLack of references for audience to compare across different facets, having relevant data labels or reference line would improve readability.\nAudience has to scroll down on each individual pyramid, making it difficult to observe patterns from quick glance.\nThe order of the planning areas in the trellis chart is not meaningful.\nThe presence of grid lines without x-axis is meaningless.\nLack of caption to present the source of data.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nGood color choices representing Male and Female population, making it easy to read.\nClear planning area labels for each population pyramid.\nUniform white background gives a clean look.\nSoft grid lines are not distracting.\nY-axis labels are not very easy to read due to presence of “_”."

    "text": "3. Makeover Design\n\n3.1 Proposed Sketch\nRough sketch of proposed design is shown below\nFrom the original visualization, it seems that the original author intends to contrast different population sizes and patterns across Singapore planning areas. This might be the reason for choosing low populated area like “Downtown Core” and highly populated area like “Tampines”. As such, it is proposed to plot the absolute (based on total population) of the age-sex pyramids of the original planning areas, ordered based on population sizes. Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Proposed sketch of the first plot\n\n\nAnother angle of visualizing age-sex pyramids is by plotting the proportion pyramids (based on proportion% of total population). This will highlight the population patterns better without being influenced by the population size. With this, we could also add reference step chart based on Singapore overall population proportion %. It is also important to have data labels highlighting the population of each planning area to avoid misleading the audience.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

The list of modifications are as follows:\n\nGroup the original data by planning area, age, and sex\nConvert Males population to negative to reverse the bar chart axis\nDerive new variables to calculate population proportion - sum of population by PA, sum of total population, and the relevant proportions\nDerive “signal” variable to help to position data labels in min/max values on the respective Males and Females charts\nFactorize “Sex” and “AG” to order its level in the plots\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Data Cleaning\n#sgpop_group groups total population by PA, AG, and Sex to create base data for population pyramid\nsgpop_group <- sgpop |> \n  mutate(AG = gsub('_',' ', AG),\n         Pop = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", Pop*(-1), Pop)) |>\n  group_by(PA, AG, Sex) |> \n  summarise(sum_pop = sum(Pop)) \n\n#sgpop_max_min creates summary parameters for max, min, and sum by grouping them on PA and Sex.

As such absolute age-sex pyramids are plotted in 3x3 trellis chart. The reasons for choosing 3x3 is to optimize the display in webpage. Having 9x1 or 1x9 will either require audience to scroll or squeeze the pyramids too closely together.\n\n\nShow the code\n#Calling the function to plot absolute population pyramid by the nine planning areas selected by peer\nplot_PA_pop(c(\"Changi\", \"Downtown Core\", \"Newton\", \"Bukit Timah\",\"Clementi\", \"Sembawang\", \"Serangoon\", \"Hougang\", \"Tampines\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second plot presents an alternative angle to the same planning areas, highlighting the population patterns better without being influenced by the population size. Reference step chart based on Singapore overall population proportion % is added to allow audience to see how different planning areas population patterns differ from national proportion. Note that the reference chart is only possible to be added in the second plot as putting this in first plot will overshadow individual planning area pyramids. This is due to sheer size of Singapore population relative to each planning area.\n\n\nShow the code\n#Calling the function to plot proportion population pyramid by the nine planning areas selected by peer\nplot_PA_prop(c(\"Changi\", \"Downtown Core\", \"Newton\", \"Bukit Timah\",\"Clementi\", \"Sembawang\", \"Serangoon\", \"Hougang\", \"Tampines\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarity\n\nConsistent scale of x-axis allows fair comparisons of population size and patterns across different planning areas. This is especially important since the range of population sizes for the planning areas differ greatly.\nAs ggplot2 plots a static chart, having grid lines are important for audience for referencing. In this case, both y and x-axis grid lines are kept to allow audience to refer even the further pyramid from the axis (top right).\nThe title describes the context of the visualization, which is to contrast population sizes and patterns across different planning areas. Subtitle also provides factual clarity of the plots with total population displayed as reference.\nOnly data labels for min and max age groups for each planning areas are provided. This is provided to still provide reference for audience without overwhelming them with too much labels.\nAnnotations on each facets with total population for different planning areas help highlighting the context further.\nReference step chart of second plot adds another dimension of comparison for audience.\nAudience can compare and contrast all pyramids in one look.\nThe order of the planning areas in the trellis chart is by population size in ascending order\nCaption is provided to present the source of data.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nClear color choices representing Male and Female population, making it easy to read.\nClear planning area labels for each population pyramid.\nUniform white background gives a clean look.\nSoft grid lines are not distracting.\nReference chart is solid line in step chart to mimic the shape of population pyramids."

    "text": "4. Learning Points\nThis exercise resembles the first assignment closely, using the same data to visualize the trellis chart of age-sex pyramids. However it requires the students to use ggplot2, its extensions, and tidyverse packages instead of Tableau. It also adds another dimension of critique and makeover of peer works which helps to embed best practices in data visualization. The key takeaways are:\n\nIt is important to start by questioning the purpose and intent of the visualization. By understanding this, one can start experimenting and designing the apt visualization from different dimensions. One example would be the second plot produced in this exercise, looking at the age-sex pyramid from the population proportion (%) rather than absolute values.\nThere is no best visualization as there might be some trade-offs between clarity and aesthetics. Adding horizontal (y-axis) grid lines in this chart presented me with a dilemma as it reduces aesthetics (by cluttering the plots), but adds additional clarity, assisting the audience to refer to the age group. This is particularly important for static visualization like this.\nLearning to critique other peer’s works help to identify pain points, to understand best practices, and to awaken new ideas that were not surfaced during Take-home Exercise 1."
